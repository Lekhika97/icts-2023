# Higgs Classification using Boosted Decision Tree and Neural Network

## Required packages:

1. NN Notebook

For the Neural Network (NN) notebook, we will use TensorFlow + Keras. Please make sure you have `tensorflow` installed. We also need some additional packages like `numpy`, `pandas`, `scikit-learn`, `matplotlib` etc.

2. BDT Notebook
For the Boosted Decision Tree (BDT) tutorial, we will use `lightgbm`. So, install it before tomorrow's session. 


Run `test_env_tf.py` to check if you have everything installed. you can use `pip insall <package name>` to install missing packages in you `conda` environment.
